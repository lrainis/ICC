			How would you feel if you were black in 1930’s America, born into poverty, and everything surrounding you was depressingly desolate, all amidst the Great Depression? In “Marigolds,” a short story by Eugenia Collier, the reader follows Lizabeth and her time over the summer.  The short story takes place in a poverty-ridden town, which Lizabeth describes as dismal and barren, and she is overall unhappy with the town and her situation as a whole. Being a teenager, she is moderately reckless and chooses to mess with an older woman, Miss Lottie, for her enjoyment. Miss Lottie does not have much going for her, though she has a bed of marigolds, bringing elegance to her otherwise repellent yard. When Lizabeth destroys Miss Lottie’s marigolds, she does so in an act of rage, and because she is jealous of the beauty Miss Lottie creates, and Lizabeth transforms into a compassionate and empathetic woman.
			<br><br>Lizabeth ultimately decides to carry out the destruction of Miss Lottie’s marigolds due to the rage she builds up over the summer and the anger she has from even earlier. When Lizabeth is running to Miss Lottie’s house to destroy the marigolds after overhearing her parents frustrating conversation about her father not finding a job, she elaborates on how nothing is going her way: “The great need for my mother who was never there, the hopelessness of our poverty and degradation, the bewilderment of being neither child nor woman and yet both at once, the fear unleashed by my father’s tears” (Collier 7). All of her anger, rage, sadness, and other emotions that are bottled up from the summer shine through and burst when she overhears her parent’s conversation, acting as the tipping point of her rage and setting off the destruction of the marigolds. However, leading to this destruction was memories built up over the years. When she describes the flowers early on in the story, she says that they are “warm and passionate and sun-golden” (4). Lizabeth recognizes that Miss Lottie is able to find beauty in a place that is without it. Miss Lottie may not have a charming home, a nice yard, or live in a pleasant town, but she has her marigolds. Lizabeth, who has similar circumstances, becomes jealous because she does not have much real beauty in her life. When Lizabeth sees the elegance that Miss Lottie brings with her marigolds, she becomes jealous and subconsciously targets the marigolds when she acts in rage.
			<br><br>After destroying the marigolds, Lizabeth is able to feel compassion and empathy for Miss Lottie; she loses her childhood innocence and can look past just the surface of people. 
			She was not capable of this before, which is evident in how she treats and looks at Miss Lottie. Furthermore, Lizabeth acknowledges that and begins to make a change when she feels remorse: “This was the beginning of compassion, and one cannot have both compassion and innocence” (8). Lizabeth realizes that her actions were uncalled for and wrong and that she never felt compassion for Miss Lottie before that. Lizabeth never looked deeper or felt bad for Miss Lottie after harassing her, behind her back and in her face. However, when Lizabeth feels remorse for her actions and blatant ignorance, Lizabeth realizes the pain that she causes and feels sympathy for Miss Lottie, maturing from a girl to a woman. Lizabeth never sympathizes or feels guilt for vexing Miss Lottie; however, with the humility Lizabeth feels after destroying the marigolds, she gains sympathy: “In that humiliating moment I looked beyond myself and into the depths of another person” (8). Lizabeth always took Miss Lottie for what she could see, a stubborn, mean, and cantankerous old woman, even going as far as thinking of the woman as a witch with her neighbors. However, Lizabeth never looks more in-depth than the surface; she uses the recondite information she has and makes assumptions. Lizabeth never considers that Miss Lottie is more like her than she might think with both of their lives being less than ideal, but Miss Lottie learns to find and create some beauty. 
			<br><br>At the beginning of the story, Lizabeth is innocent, and she does not understand more than what she can see at the surface with the people that are not close to her. However, there is a sudden shift at the end of the story where Lizabeth gains compassion and feels remorse for her actions, recognizing that Miss Lottie is not a witch like she previously thought and is simply just an older woman who dares to bring beauty into their sterile world. In the end, Lizabeth ends up subconsciously targeting the marigolds, which causes her to face Miss Lottie. In this moment of humility, a drastic change occurs: Lizabeth gains compassion and empathy.</p>
