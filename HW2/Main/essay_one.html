			<p style="border:2px solid midnightblue; padding:20px; border-radius: 5px">Is drastic change necessary for the immense betterment of civilizations and societies? In Pre-Islamic Arabia, fertile land was sparse. It was rare, of high value, and not commonly shared. So many wanted it to grow crops and for other land uses, and thus these rare areas were fiercely protected. Due to the limited water, land, and overall resources, these communities could not sustain many people, and therefore they formed small communities, also known as clans. Clans were extended families, typically a large number between 50-100, and these tribes would interact with other tribes for trade and marriage. As a result of these harsh conditions, the gods reflected these values and were cruel and punitive. There was no central government, but instead, it was tribal and communal, no set laws, but rather a general idea of how to act. Concepts like the law of retribution, which states, "Only an eye for an eye, nothing more," were commonly followed. This code of conduct was a way for the clans to end the cycle of violence and the barbaric nature of the tribes. When the Byzantine empire went to war with the Persians, the silk road subsequently shifted south into Mecca, Muhammad’s birth spot, making Mecca now a center of business. The Ka'aba was a wealthy religious-economic system that relied on the control of the Ka'aba and its rites to guarantee the economic, religious, and political supremacy of one tribe. It was a spiritual center that people were required to pay to visit, and thus the tribe controlled the economic and religious superiority. Muhammad underwent three remarkably tough obstacles during his life, including being orphaned at age six and the death of other prominent figures, the deterioration of tribal values, and living under the Quraysh oligarchy and control of the Ka'aba.
			<br><br>
			The earliest and one of Muhammad’s most significant challenges occured early on when he was orphaned at six and later lost two prominent figures in his life. At the age of six, Muhammad was orphaned to a relative, Abu Talib, after his mother and grandfather passed. Muhammad’s father already died before he was born, and later on, he would lose his grandfather, guardian, and wife. Losing a parent is tough, and it was not any easier for Muhammad. Before he was even born, his father died, meaning he did not have any father figure to guide and mentor him growing up. Additionally, his mother died when he was six, meaning he was orphaned and forced to live with his uncle, Abu Talib. This was hard on Muhammad, as he did not have a mentor to guide him through life and teach him from an early age. Additionally, Muhammad was not wealthy, nor did he have access to sufficient resources, yet he was still exposed to many cultures while traveling with his uncle and now guardian. Only once Muhammad's wealthy wife dies around the age of 65, the same time that Abu Talib also passes, that for the first time in his life, Muhammad experiences wealth after inheriting it from his late wife. He had lost his father, mother, guardian, and now wife. His wife, Khadija, gave Muhammad a mother-like figure, as she was significantly older than him, and is likely why he took to her. When Muhammad lost two of the most prominent figures in his life, it was tragic and induced a revelation once he gained wealth. From an early age, Muhammad gained exposure to harsh conditions; he was orphaned at age six and was poor until his wealthy wife passed away at the same time as his guardian; however, this was not the only challenge Muhammad faced.

			When the silk road shifts south into the once notably tribal and communal area of Mecca, Muhammad starts to see the effects of capitalism and the deterioration and erosion of tribal values in Arabia. The silk road shifted due to the Byzantine empire being at war with the Persian empire, and thus trade went through Mecca, which happened to be Muhammad’s birthplace. With the silk road bringing lots of trade through Mecca, it turned into a center of trade in a once extremely communal and tribal-oriented Mecca, and the rapid invasion of capitalism began. Before the silk road shifted, the majority of Mecca was tribal-based. Resources were scarce, and thus people were spread out. There were large families, or clans made up of around 100-150 people. However, when the silk road and capitalism invaded these towns, the deterioration of these once tribal values started. Clans would begin to separate and form smaller families. Because everyone valued their money so highly, it made sense as to why these clans split up, as no one would want to share their fortune with over 100 people, they desired to keep their money. This resulted in much smaller families, usually around six members, which prevailed due to capitalism, and individuals started to look out for themself only, not the large group. Instead of benefiting or working towards the greater good of the group, individuals would work for themselves and look out for themselves or their immediate family. Muhammad is able to see this, and he realizes how bad this divide has come to after his wife dies and he inherits her fortune. Since Mecca was now broadly divided, divisions among social classes and wealth classes prevailed, and Muhammad eventually recognized this and had to overcome it. Drastic, quick change is not easy, and the deterioration of tribal values shifted Mecca significantly, yet another challenge came from the rapid spread of capitalism.
			<br><br>
			With the rise of individualism, a powerful oligarchy of the richest in the Quraysh tribe quickly took control of the working class and the Ka'aba, establishing an economy focused around the worship of polytheism. As a result of the silk road shift, the oligarchy that is the top few in the Quraysh tribe took control of the Ka'aba, a religious center, and made people pay to visit them to worship the many gods. This resulted in lots of visitors to Mecca and the spread of polytheistic views. This continued to make the richest richer and caused the divide between rich and poor more prominent. The top of the Quraysh controlled the Ka'aba, resulting in the control of pilgrimages to there, which cost money and thus established an economy based mainly on religion and polytheism. The rule of the Ka'aba was critical, as anyone who controlled it also had control of the accepted and practiced faith, economics, and politics in Mecca. The society formed around the oligarchy was not a clan with wealth distribution like we had seen prior; the clan’s views were now more capitalistic and shifted towards individualism, and the wealth was not distributed evenly. Thus, the wealthy got richer, which resulted in more and more control of Mecca, forming an oligarchy. The top members of the Quraysh tribe and their control of the Ka'aba further increased the wealth disparity among the Quraysh tribe and the citizens of Mecca. Once Muhammad married into wealth and inherited it after his older wife dies, he has a  revelation and recognizes the suffering and disparity among members of his tribe. He takes on the challenge of overcoming this control and eventually starts preaching about one god in front of the Ka'aba, contradicting its polytheistic views, and gains more support, ultimately creating Islam. This became a considerable challenge for Muhammad to overcome through finally, according to theology, a revelation and by preaching about one god in front of the sanctuary that preached polytheistic views, a stark contradiction, and a brave ordeal.
			<br><br>
			Muhammad did not have everything handed to him, as evident in him being orphaned from an early age. Everything started coming together after the unfortunate passing of his wealthy wife, Khadija, and his guardian, Abu Talib. When the silk road shifted into Mecca, rapid change occurred, and views moved from collective to individualistic. The large tribes split up, causing a massive deterioration of the tribal values that once prevailed. Finally, when the Ka'aba is conquered by Qusay, who later goes on to found the Quraysh tribe, and Mecca falls under the rule of that oligarchy, and the Ka'aba is shifted towards selling polytheism. The polytheistic ideas spread across Mecca and Arabia, and people paid to visit the Ka'aba, making the rich richer and sustaining an oligarchy of the richest in the Quraysh tribe. In the end, although Muhammad was not born with favorable life circumstances and underwent several challenges throughout his life, he overcame all of them, converting people from all over to Islam and establishing his rule and the importance of Islam. So, while we may not invite it, often drastic change is necessary for revolutions and the betterment of societies, even if it comes with its challenges at first.</p></div>
